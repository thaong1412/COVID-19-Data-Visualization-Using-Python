# COVID-19 Data Visualization Using Python | Coursera Project

In this project-based course on Coursera, I explored the use of data visualization techniques to analyze and understand the global impact of COVID-19. The project involved using Python's powerful Seaborn library to create insightful and interactive visualizations from a real-world dataset, focusing on key metrics such as the number of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- **Data Visualization for Analysis**: I learned how to leverage visualizations to answer analytical questions related to the spread of COVID-19, gaining a deeper understanding of the global trends and patterns.
- **Use of Seaborn in Python**: I developed proficiency in using the Seaborn library, creating dynamic graphs, including choropleth maps and bar charts, to visualize the spread of the virus across countries and regions.
- **Impact of Lockdowns**: The project also focused on the analysis of the effect of national lockdowns, with a specific case study on Italy, visualizing how these measures impacted both the virus transmission and death rates.

## Project Highlights

1. **Global Spread of COVID-19**: Created choropleth maps to visually represent the spread of COVID-19 worldwide from the onset of the pandemic.
2. **Comparing Virus Transmission by Country**: Used bar charts to compare the intensity of COVID-19 transmission across various countries, highlighting the most affected regions.
3. **Impact of National Lockdowns**: Analyzed the effect of Italy's national lockdown on virus transmission and death rates, providing insights into the effectiveness of such interventions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn**: Visualization library used to create interactive graphs and maps.

This project provided me with valuable experience in applying data visualization techniques to real-world datasets, enabling me to derive actionable insights and communicate complex data trends effectively. It also strengthened my Python skills, particularly in using Seaborn for creating professional visualizations.
